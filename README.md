# foodsystemABM

The FFAR-ABModel was created to allow us to address scenarios relevant to Colorado and the Denver Public Schools under the Good Food Purchasing Program. Questions under that program include, for example, changing the origin of commodities purchased to favor Colorado products or shifts in differentiated commodities to promote the purchase of presumably healthier options or those that may contribute less to carbon emissions or use less water. Four commodities were selected for inclusion in the model, potatoes, wheat, beef, and peaches.
